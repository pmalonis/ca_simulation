    "\n",
    "In the CNMF framework, calcium transients are are generated by an AR(2) process. The appendex of [reference] shows that this model is a discrete-time approximation of a continuous model consisting of spikes convolved with a difference of exponential kernel. So to generate the simulation, the first step is to approximate the parameters of this kernel based on the measured response properties of GCaMP6s, given in [reference]. \n",

    "The kernel of the continuous process is given by \n",

    "$$h(t) = \\exp \\left(\\frac{-t}{\\tau_d} \\right) - \\exp \\left(\\frac{-t}{\\tau_r} \\right), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau_r$ is the rise time constant and $\\tau_d$ is the decay time constant. [reference] lists values for the transient peak time, $\\tau_{peak}$, and the half decay time $\\tau_{half}$. To solve for $\\tau_r$ and $\\tau_d$ in terms of $\\tau_{peak}$, and $\\tau_{half}$, we will solve the follwing system of equations.\n",
